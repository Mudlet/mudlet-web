// Mudlet spec assertions mudix deliberately does not satisfy.
//
// Every entry here is a place where matching desktop Mudlet would make this
// client *worse*, not a gap waiting to be closed. They are recorded here rather
// than edited out of the corpus because `src/scripting/lua/specs/` is a verbatim
// mirror of Mudlet's own tests (see its SYNCED.md) — a re-sync must be able to
// overwrite that tree without silently reverting a decision made here.
//
// These are **expected failures**, not skips: busted.spec.ts marks each with
// `test.fail()`, so a run stays green while one keeps failing and turns RED the
// moment one starts passing. That matters — an entry that quietly went stale
// would hide the day mudix grew the behaviour, or the day upstream rewrote the
// spec to test something else entirely. A guard test also checks every name here
// still matches a live it(), so a rename upstream cannot leave a dead entry
// papering over a real failure.
//
// Adding one is a decision to diverge from Mudlet. Write down *why matching
// would be wrong*, not just what fails — the next person needs to be able to
// disagree with the reasoning, which they cannot do from a symptom.
